# PEAS
**Package for Elementary Analysis for SNP data**

Developed by Shuhua Xu. PEAS can handle very large data set, it is versatile especially in formatting, data splitting, data combining, sampling for both markers and individuals for further analysis. To fill up the gaps of currently available programs, PEAS are designed to calculate individual allele sharing distance, population genetic distances, do bootstrapping and calculating LD statistics for large-scale SNP data set. As the assistant tools of many other popular programs, PEAS are also designed to provide formatted input files for many programs, such as fastPHASE, PHASE, STRUCTURE, Haploview, Arlequin and LDhat and so on. PEAS can also manage the output results of some other programs.

PEAS for Windows is also freely available for academic users from
